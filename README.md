# Segment Tree Examples

- Following is stand alone cabal project to test the solutions presented in [segment-trees](https://github.com/sourabhxyz/haskell-competitive-programming/tree/main/segment-trees) repository. To run standalone haskell files in that repository, one would need to add packages to `lib` like so: `cabal install --lib package-name`, this project avoids that.
